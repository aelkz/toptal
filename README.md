## The IT professional is also a human being

In my whole career I have faced many situations that put me in position to decide and act promptly. We all are indulged to deal with the best and worse situations. The good professional knows how to deal with them and take control over emotions, particular issues and specially family matters. 

In a recent conversation with a coleague of mine, we are talking how managers deal with their personal lives: some of them act as robots without emotions and lead their team with extremelly and acurate efficiency, loosing some social aspects with their family members. Others act with less engagement, in order to preserve their social lives and keep the flow constant.

As a technician I've been put into some situations that required me to decide to act as a robot or as a human being. It is not something we can control with some switch or a simple card turnover. As a employee I have obligations and I have to be professional and meet all expectations to attend with deadlines and participate with the team engagement.

In some past experience I have faced an extremely critical situation, that have put me with a coleague and the project manager to publish a software release in production environment, in order to meet the project deadline. We had a deadline to meet because some of the stakeholders are expecting to use the application in no time. We have to deal with this situation in Friday just at the end of the regular working time.

All of us three acted as a unique prcessing unit, working like if each other was some piece of a greater machine. Each other had some task to attend and no one was crossed arms waiting for something to be done. That's the moment when I realized the team engagement. When you work with a team that keeps the flow constant and well aligned, I think we can do something that I call: team flow. Team flow works when only all the team members works acting as a unique and necessary gear.

Working as a team, we expect to deal with every kind of situation. Knowing how to deal with them is something that defines the mature of the team to solve critical situations like that one I faced in the past time. If someone in the team had different toughts or choosen the wrong direction, I think we are not able to deliver the project in time.

As a professional, I have to expect to work with other people and treat them with respect. I need to act as a robot in terms of efficiency and quality of the product I've been put to design, but I need to know how to increase or decrease my sense of helping if someone is acting lower than expected, to keep the team working as a unique processing unit.
